# WME-Quick-HN-advanced
Waze Map Editor script allowing quick and easy house numbers creation.

It's based on https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/21378-wme-quick-hn

It handles non typical house numbers, such as `1a, 1b`, `1/2, 2/2, 3/2`, `1a/1, 1a/2, 1a/3` and more. Not all are supported by the WME itself, nevertheless the script is ready and can handle quite wide range of formats.
